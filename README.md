The identity certificate should be issue by just one Certificate Authority
Each company should be able to check/query attributes from a participant
A single DID should be enough to query all the information related to one identity, and his attributes
Only the company that certifies an attribute can edit it


The flow:
- Can register new identities
- Can delete identities
- Can disarm identities
